# Field Relative Swerve Drive: #
  Swerve drive with field oriented and robot oriented movement. Also contains pose estimation using encoders. Swerve drive also uses open
  and closed loop drive motor control.

# Intake: #
  Intake consisting of dual NEO control, a color sensor that allows for game piece detection and game piece identification
